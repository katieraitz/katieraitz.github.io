## About Me

My name is Kate Raitz and I began the CS@Mines Bridge Program in Fall of 2021. My previous education had been earning a Master's degree in Psychology, with a focus on clinical applications. I applied these clinical applications in rehabilitation therapy for adolescents, a study on the community impact on grief work, and behavioral therapy using Applied Behavior Analysis with children. As I worked with behavior analysis, I grew more interested in the cognitive processes that are behind learning, and so I started volunteering as a lab assistant in a research group at George Mason University called the Computational Social Neuroscience Group. Here I collected behavioral data using a computational model of Pavlovian-Instrumental interactions during social and monetary reinforcement learning tasks. This is what initially got me interested in machine learning. I wanted to learn better computational skills for use in neuroscience, and so I started moving towards returning to school for computer science (CS). Now, after being trained and better learning the skills needed behind predictive analyses, I am focusing on gaining Data Science skills.

For my first year in the Bridge program, I was working a full-time office job, and I completed introductory coursework as a part-time student. I learned basic programming and data structures, as well as computer organization and the Linux system. My second year at school I learned more about operating systems, computer architecture, discrete maths, programming algorithms, machine learning, and computational numerical analyses. This third year, I have been strengthening my mathematical maturity by working with calculus, probabilty, and linear algebra. I plan to graduate in December of 2024 with a MS in CS.

## About My Advisor

I chose to do research with Dr. Samy Wu Fung, Assistant Professor of both Applied Mathematics and Statistics (AMS) and CS departments at Colorado School of Mines, because of his research focusing on optimization and deep learning. Our project employs a [novel method pioneered by my advisor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12803), which has proven to be highly effective in reducing memory requirements for implicit neural networks. Dr. Samy's website is https://swufung.github.io.

## About My Project
I'm studying how to solve complex mathematical problems in deep learning, focusing on a technique called fixed point analysis. This involves looking at how neural networks can learn without relying on traditional methods like gradient descent-based backpropagation. I'm particularly interested in a type of neural network called implicit networks, which have layers based on fixed points. My main goal is to understand how efficient these networks are compared to conventional neural networks. I'm also exploring how their different approach affects things like training and error calculation. I'll be sharing updates on my progress in My Blog.
